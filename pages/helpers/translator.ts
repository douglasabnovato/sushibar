      "The grapes for the Flume Crossing Sauvignon Blanc are grown in the well-drained, sandy, cobblestone soils deposited by the Arroyo Seco River. These rugged soils keep yields in check and produce fruit with varietal intensity, minerality and exceptional weight. The long cool growing season of the Arroyo Seco appellation ensures that the fleeting, exotic fruit flavors of Sauvignon Blanc are retained along with a vibrant natural acidity. The Flume Crossing Sauvignon Blanc is created to be an expression of pure varietal character, influenced only by its terroir, gently guided by minimal farming and winemaking practices. Pale yellow in color and displays aromas of honeysuckle, sweet herbs, lime, and fig. These aromas are complemented on the palate by the bright flavors of grapefruit, kiwi, passionfruit, and lemongrass, with the rich texture and long finish provided by the acacia barrels. This wine has earned the Certified California Sustainable seal.",

It is 100% stainless steel fermented with a Stelvin screw cap closure helps to preserve the aromatic freshness and youthfulness of the wine. Pair this white wine Chardonnay with sushi, halibut, fried calamari and fish tacos for an excellent meal.\n\nKendall-Jackson is committed to producing only the finest quality wines from Chardonnay grape varietals grown in California. One aspect that distinguishes a Kendall-Jackson wine is vineyard sourcing. The majority of fruit sourced for Kendall-Jackson wines is grown on the 12,000 acres of estate vineyards owned by the Jackson family. All of the estate vineyards are certified sustainable by the CCSW (Certified California Sustainable Winegrowing) and SIP (Sustainability in Practice) programs. The proprietary approach to winemaking has earned Kendall-Jackson a world-renowned reputation for white wines that consistently exhibit signature rich layers of flavor, combined with a delicate balance.\n\nThis bottled wine has a 13.5% ABV.",

Glorious vistas. Fresh air. A chance to reconnect with nature. Wildlife sightings Thoreau, Emerson, and Audubon all waxed poetic about the joys of the outdoor world, but here’s one thing that never came up in their verse: the food. It’s a funny little trick of nature that the farther you get out in the middle of it, the more proficient you’d better be at hunting, gathering, harvesting, and campfire cooking.<br />But then we realized that we’re actually pretty darned good at hunting down deliciously chocolatey ice cream, gathering crunchy and gooey swirls to fill it, and stalking the perfect herd of fudge covered almonds to make a wildly delicious concoction. So go ahead: go for that camping trip Or simply crack a pint of Glampfire Trail Mix, grab a spoon and kick your feet up no campfire required though we do think it tastes even better under the stars<br />We get all starry eyed over our ingredients, which is why we use Fairtrade certified cocoa, sugar, and vanilla in this pint, as well as cage free eggs, Non GMO ingredients and milk from our Caring Dairy Program. And because we love nature too, we also wrap it up in responsibly sourced packaging for a treat that you and the earth can love",
